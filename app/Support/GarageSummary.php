/**
 * The counts the app shell needs: how much is due across the whole garage, and
 * how many vehicles want a fresh odometer reading.
 *
 * Shared globally so a due item is visible from anywhere rather than only from
 * the garage — previously you had to go looking for it, which rather defeats
 * the point of a reminder.
 *
 * Deliberately computed rather than stored: progress depends on a PROJECTED
 * odometer, which moves with the clock, so a cached count would be wrong by
 * tomorrow. It costs two queries and some arithmetic over a handful of rows.
