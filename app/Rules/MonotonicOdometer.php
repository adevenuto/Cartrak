/**
 * Odometer readings must be monotonic, because the mileage estimate and every
 * gauge built on it depend on clean data.
 *
 * Crucially this is monotonic *in time*, not merely "higher than the newest
 * reading". Backfilling past history is a first-class flow — the brief makes
 * manual backfill the only way to record a vehicle's past — so a reading dated
 * last year is checked against its neighbours on either side of that date, not
 * against today's odometer.
 *
 * Implausibly large jumps are not rejected outright; they ask for confirmation,
 * matching the rule that assisted input never silently commits.
